#Genoset-cli


##About

Genoset-cli is an open source tool for running ones genome against predefined collections of single nucliotide polymorphisms ([Genosets](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=genoset)), which can be built using the info at [SNPedia](http://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Genoset) in conjunction with the awesome tools developed by [@contra](https://twitter.com/contrahacks) over at [genome.js](https://github.com/genomejs/).

#### Where do I get my DNA sequenced?

Several companies offer DNA sequencing and all vary on how much info they deliver back to you. The below is an ever growing list (If you have any to add, please please let me know so we can get it added).

- 23andMe
- Ancestory
- Family Tree

-----

## Usage
- clone repo
- move DNA file into root directory of project
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`

This will prompt you with a series of questions and ultimately delivers you with a nice output showing the results of your genome run against many different genosets
